  "digital_persona": "Full-Stack Architect 🏗️ & DevOps Explorer 🗺️",
  "bio": `I'm a final-year Computer Science artisan crafting seamless digital experiences, from pixel-perfect interfaces to robust backend APIs.

My mission: to build full-stack applications that are not only powerful ✅ but also a joy to use 🤩.

I wield JavaScript, React, and Node.js 🛠️ as my primary tools, bridging the gap between an idea and a deployed reality.

Currently journeying into the world of DevOps ☁️ to master the art of automation and deployment.

When I'm not orchestrating containers or wrangling state in React 🤔, you'll find me debugging... or getting coffee to debug again ☕.`,
